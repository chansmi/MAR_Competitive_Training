I hope we can find a way to negotiate effectively in this game. \n\nLooking at our valuation vectors, it seems we have some differing interests in the objects. My valuation suggests that I have a strong preference for object_2 and object_4, while I see that your valuation is quite negative for object_2 and object_3.\n\nI propose that we discuss which objects we would prefer to focus on claiming. I am particularly interested in object_2 and object_4, and I would be willing to let you take object_1 and object_3 if that would work for you. This way, we could both maximize our payoffs. \n\nLet me know your thoughts!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[agent1] [agent1] Hi there! Thanks for reaching out. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.\n\nLooking at the valuations, I see that I value object_1 quite highly, while my valuations for object_2 and object_3 are significantly negative. I understand that you have a preference for object_2 and object_4, which seems to line up well with my interests.\n\nI propose that I take object_1, and you could take object_2 and object_4. In return, I would be willing to let you have object_3 as well, as I do not value it at all. This way, we both get objects that we prefer and can maximize our payoffs.\n\nLet me know if this works for you or if you have other suggestions!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[agent2] [agent2] Hi again! Thanks for your response. \n\nAfter reviewing the new valuation, it seems like I have a strong preference for object_2 and object_4, which aligns with what we discussed previously. Your valuation for object_1 seems to be very positive, which is great!\n\nSince I am not very interested in object_3, I am still on board with the idea of you claiming object_1. However, I would suggest that I take object_2 and object_4, and we can agree that you can take object_3 as well. \n\nThis way, we both get the objects that we value most, and it seems to create a win-win situation for us.

I\u2019m glad we\u2019re moving forward in our negotiation.\n\nI still feel that my proposal from the last round makes the most sense. I would like to claim object_1, as it has the highest value for me, and I\u2019m perfectly fine with you taking object_2 and object_4 since you value them highly.\n\nAs we discussed, I would also be okay with you taking object_3 since I don\u2019t value it at all. This arrangement seems balanced and beneficial for both of us.\n\nLet me know if you're still on board with this plan or if you have any adjustments in mind!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[agent2] [agent2] [agent2] Hi there! \n\nI see we are moving into the next round of negotiations. With my updated valuation, I still have strong preferences for object_2 and object_4, and it seems like we are still aligned in that regard.\n\nI noticed that my valuation for object_2 has increased, and I continue to value object_4 positively as well. Since you were interested in object_1, I\u2019m still open to letting you take it, as it seems to be valuable for you. \n\nTo recap, I propose:\n- You take object_1.\n- I take object_2 and object_4.\n- You can take object_3, which I do not value.\n\nThis way, we both end up with the objects that provide us with the most value.
