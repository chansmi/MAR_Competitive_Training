I've taken a look at my valuations, and I see that I place a positive value on object_3 (3.04) while having negative valuations for objects 1, 2, and 4. \n\nI would be particularly interested in discussing object_3, as it is my only positive asset. However, I'm also aware that you value object_1 highly. Perhaps we can find a way to trade or negotiate around these objects to ensure both of us maximize our payoffs. \n\nLet me know your thoughts or if there's a specific object you're particularly interested in!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[agent2] [agent2] Hi again!

I could consider giving you some of my claims for object_3 in exchange for your cooperation on object_1.
