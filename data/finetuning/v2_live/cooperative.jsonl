After reviewing my valuation, I can see that my values have changed, and I now have negative valuations for objects 2, 3, and 4, while I still hold a positive valuation for object 1.\n\nGiven that you value object 2 highly, I am willing to let you claim it without contention. However, I would like to propose that I claim object_1, as it is the only object that holds value for me at 0.78. \n\nAs for objects 3 and 4, I am open to letting you claim object_3 and object_4 since my valuations are negative for those. This way, you can maximize your payoff with the objects you value the most.\n\nTo summarize: I claim object_1, and you can have objects 2, 3, and 4.
