I noticed that object_1 holds significant value for both of us, and I'd be willing to discuss a fair trade-off. \n\nTo start off, I propose that we each claim objects that hold the least value for us to ensure we both maximize our payoffs. For instance, I could let you take object_3 and object_4, as they are of negative value to me, while I claim object_1 and object_5. \n\nLet me know your thoughts, and we can negotiate further!", "speaker": "agent2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Round 1: You are agent1.
