It's clear that object_3 is a key point of interest for both of us. Since it's valuable to both parties, I suggest we consider a strategy for object_3. \n\nHow about we agree to claim object_3 together this round, which would allow us both to receive a portion of its value? Then we can each focus on the other objects based on our respective valuations. For instance, I would like to prioritize claiming object_1 for myself, given its positive valuation for me.\n\nLet me know what you think about this approach!

I think sharing object_3 is a solid idea since it holds significant value for both of us.
