We use GPT-4o-mini to (1) generate synthetic negotiation transcripts under each scenario, (2) filter and use high-quality transcripts for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and (3) fine-tune three LLMs (Models A, B, and C) on data from each context. Finally, we conduct cross-play evaluations on held-out games to quantify both individual payoffs and overall social welfare.
